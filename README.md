A usable but fairly featureless khinsider downloader written in Go. I use it myself but I need to clean up the code and write some more docs

Executables are available under releases.

If you're looking for something more feature complete, check out [obskyr](https://github.com/obskyr)'s original which inspired this one: https://github.com/obskyr/khinsider
